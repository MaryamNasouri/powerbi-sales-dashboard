* Key Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis of the 2015-2018 data, the following strategic insights were generated:
**Regional Opportunity:** The West region consistently generates the highest sales volume; however, the Central region shows the fastest year-over-year growth trend. 
**Recommendation:** Invest targeted marketing resources into the Central region to capitalize on its high growth potential.
**Performance Gap:** The Office Supplies category, despite having a high volume of orders, lags significantly in Total Sales compared to Technology. This suggests a focus on lower-margin items. 
**Action:** A separate profitability analysis is recommended to optimize the Office Supplies product mix.
